            <h2>Policies</h2>
            <p>
              Authors may be involved in at most two abstracts and may be the
              sole author of at most one abstract.
            </p>
            <p>
              SALT does not accept papers that at the time of the conference have been
              published or have been accepted for publication. In addition,
              preference will be given to presentations that are not duplicated
              at other major conferences. We therefore request that authors
              indicate prior, pending, or planned presentations of their papers
              along with their contact information when they submit their
              abstracts.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Proceedings</h2>
            <p>
              All papers presented at the conference will be published in a SALT
              29 volume following the conclusion of the conference.
